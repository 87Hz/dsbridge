# dsbridge-electron

DSBridge (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsbridge) is an awesome library for communication between Native (iOS and Android) and WebView.

If you have a library using DSBridge and would like to reuse it in Electron without additional build process, this package will serve that purpose.

## APIs

Mostly based on DSBridge-Android API: https://github.com/wendux/DSBridge-Android
